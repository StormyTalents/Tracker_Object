<h3>An object recognition tool using OpenCV which uses color-based detection techniques, such as thresholding and the Hough Circle Transform to detect, learn, and then track different objects.</h3>

<p>Using video from your webcam, Object Tracker will detect circular objects which you can then choose to track. After choosing an object, it will then determine the optimal HSV range for thresholding and then track the object based on that range.</p>
